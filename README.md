# My Personal File Management System

As a part of my push to create more summer projects, I've taken inspiration from [Kalle's Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbW6FRbaSl0) for Python Automation. Additionally, I've gone one step further and automated the process of adding directories.

## How do I use this?

You can use this application by performing two easy steps.

- Clone the repository onto your local desktop.
- Change the DIR global variable to your desired path.

## Screenshots / Video?

To be added.

## More features.

Automatically delete folders once the folder becomes empty.
